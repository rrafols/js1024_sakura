The source code of the entry (unpacked) can be found [here](./demo.js). I run into some trouble with RegPack when packing the source for the release, so I had to hash the Context API manually and use _Terser_ / _JSCrush_ to reduce it under 1k. 

This manually hashed version can be found here: [demo_hashed.js](./demo_hashed.js)

# Inspiration
Once again, I used some inspiration by some awesome artists out there. In this case, I was inpired by this Unity3D Experiment by [Max Gittel / @maxSigma_](https://twitter.com/maxSigma_): https://twitter.com/maxSigma_/status/1264900383081664514

The original experiment can also be found on Max's GitHub: https://github.com/MaxSigma/UnityExperiments
